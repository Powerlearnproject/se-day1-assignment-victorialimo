Version Control & GitHub
Version control tracks code changes, allowing collaboration and history management. GitHub is popular because it provides cloud-based repositories, collaboration tools, and integration with other services.

Project Integrity with Version Control
It prevents data loss, maintains a history of changes, and allows multiple developers to work without overwriting each other’s code.

Setting Up a GitHub Repository
Create an account, click "New Repository," name it, choose public/private, add a README, and initialize with a license if needed.

Importance of a README File
It explains the project’s purpose, setup instructions, usage, and contribution guidelines, helping new users and collaborators understand the project.

Public vs. Private Repositories
Public repositories are open to everyone, encouraging collaboration but exposing the code. Private repositories restrict access, offering more control and security.

Making Your First Commit
Commits save changes in a repository. Steps: initialize Git, add files (git add), commit (git commit -m "message"), and push to GitHub (git push).

Branching in Git
Branches allow parallel development without affecting the main code. Steps: create (git branch), switch (git checkout), work, and merge (git merge).

Pull Requests & Collaboration
Pull requests propose changes, enable review, and merge code safely. Steps: create a branch, commit changes, open a pull request, review, and merge.

Forking vs. Cloning
Forking copies a repository to your GitHub account for independent changes. Cloning downloads a repository locally for direct work. Forking is useful for contributing to others’ projects.

Issues & Project Boards
Issues track bugs and tasks, while project boards organize workflow. Example: a team can assign issues to members and track progress visually.

Common GitHub Challenges & Best Practices
New users struggle with merge conflicts and commit mistakes. Best practices: write clear commit messages, use branches properly, and communicate with the team.
